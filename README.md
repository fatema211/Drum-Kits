# Drum-Kits
A fun and interactive JavaScript project that lets you play drum sounds using your computer keyboard or by clicking on the  buttons. This project is built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and DOM manipulation, which combines event listeners and audio manipulation to create a virtual drum kit experience.
